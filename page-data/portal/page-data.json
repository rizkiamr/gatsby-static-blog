Rather than just endlessly posting\nand hoping someone is listening, you can track real signups against your work\nand have them subscribe to be notified of future posts. The feature that makes\nall this possible is called Portal.\n\nPortal is an embedded interface for your audience to sign up to your site. It\nworks on every Ghost site, with every theme, and for any type of publisher. \n\nYou can customize the design, content and settings of Portal to suit your site,\nwhether you just want people to sign up to your newsletter — or you're running a\nfull premium publication with user sign-ins and private content.\n\nOnce people sign up to your site, they'll receive an email confirmation with a\nlink to click. The link acts as an automatic sign-in, so subscribers will be\nautomatically signed-in to your site when they click on it. There are a couple\nof interesting angles to this:\n\nBecause subscribers are automatically able to sign in and out of your site as\nregistered members: You can (optionally) restrict access to posts and pages\ndepending on whether people are signed-in or not. So if you want to publish some\nposts for free, but keep some really great stuff for members-only, this can be a\ngreat draw to encourage people to sign up!\n\nGhost members sign in using email authentication links, so there are no\npasswords for people to set or forget. You can turn any list of email\nsubscribers into a database of registered members who can sign in to your site.\nLike magic.\n\nPortal makes all of this possible, and it appears by default as a floating\nbutton in the bottom-right corner of your site. When people are logged out,\nclicking it will open a sign-up/sign-in window. When members are logged in,\nclicking the Portal button will open the account menu where they can edit their\nname, email, and subscription settings.\n\nThe floating Portal button is completely optional. If you prefer, you can add\nmanual links to your content, navigation, or theme to trigger it instead.\n\nLike this!
